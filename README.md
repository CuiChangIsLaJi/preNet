# preNet
This is a part of my graduation project, where you can train a Convolution Network named preNet to predict and understand the mechanism of pre-let-7/LIN28A axis. Welcome to download, run and evaluate my work !
# Structure of the repository

# Basic usage
The first step you might want is to create a directory to dump the results.  `<mkdir results  cd results  mkdir eval  mkdir grad_cam>`
